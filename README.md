We designed a Neural Network Accelerator for Darknet Reference Model (which is 2.9 times faster than AlexNet and attains the same top-1 and top-5 performance as AlexNet but with 1/10th the parameters) for image classification on Imagenet Dataset. Designed a CNN accelerator on Intel Cyclone V SoC FPGA using High Level Synthesis tools and languages. When connected to ARM Cortex A9 processor using OpenCL framework, it achieved around 300% faster inference speed than CPU.

### [AWS SageMaker - Fraud Detector service](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/projects/aws-fraud-detector)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/jithendrabsy/Side-Projects/tree/main/aws-SageMaker-fraud-detection)

Built fraud detector service using services provided by AWS. Trained machine learning job and deployed model using SageMaker,
created endpoint that can be invoked by Lambda, created API with
API Gateway in order to send request to flask application. Deployed the application on AWS Cloud9 environment and finally
integrated the application with SNS service to alert client by sending
email when fraud is detected.

### [Heartbeat Anamoly detection](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/projects/heartbeat-anomaly-detection)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/jithendrabsy/Side-Projects/tree/main/heart-ECG-anomaly-detection)

Detected anomalies in heartbeats using LSTM Auto-encoder. The dataset used contains 5000 time series sequences with 140
timestamps obtained with ECG and corresponds to heartbeats from a
single patient. Trained and evaluated autoencoder, chose a threshold for anomaly
detection and finally classified unseen examples as normal or anomaly.

### [When Music meets Data Science!](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/projects/when-music-meets-data-science)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/jithendrabsy/Side-Projects/tree/main/when-music-meets-datascience)

As a music nerd and active user of Spotify with more than 40K minutes streaming history in 2020, I was curious about statistics of my favorite artists and top artists on Spotify. This project is a series of mini-projects which includes Analyzing my Spotify streaming history, analyzing music discographies of my most favorite artists, Seeing what's common between top songs on Spotify from 2010-19 and Clustering songs into playlists.

### [Forecasting Air pollution](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/projects/forecasting-air-pollution)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/jithendrabsy/Side-Projects/tree/main/forecasting-air-pollution)

Analyzed Beijing air quality data to understand patterns in air
pollution. Compared the performance of different univariate and multivariate
methods like SARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, LightGBM. The performance has been increased using combination of different
models.
