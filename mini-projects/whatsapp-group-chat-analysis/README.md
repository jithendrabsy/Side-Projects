# whatsapp-group-chat-analysis

In this fun project, I decided to try my hands on text data for the 1st time. I analysed the text data from a whatsapp group of my friends! I performed some basic cleaning and then analysis. Whatsapp has an option export the chat into .txt file! I used that to extract the group chat messages!
